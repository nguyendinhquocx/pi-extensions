# @narumitw/pi-codex-compact

## 0.53.3

### Patch Changes

- 8abd5b7: Keep generated extension runtime graphs inside Pi's Jiti-loaded TypeScript path to avoid duplicate peer-runtime evaluation during startup. Add measured generated runtimes for Context Management, Herdr, and TypeSafe Search.

## 0.53.2

### Patch Changes

- 67a3049: Adapt provider, transcript, usage, deferred-tool, and telemetry behavior to Pi's current runtime contracts, including accurate cache-warming accounting and exclusion from ordinary generation traces.

### Patch Changes

- eeede25: Allow managed npm installs without physical Pi peer packages to open the settings menu.

## 0.53.0

### Minor Changes

- 2edfea9: Support explicit Codex Responses compatibility profiles for custom Pi model APIs, including safe checkpoint replay authorization and migration of earlier checkpoints.

## 0.52.0

### Minor Changes

- ac74542: Add Remote V2 and unary Responses Compact routing for OpenAI Codex, OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, and compatible custom providers while preserving existing checkpoints.

## 0.51.0

### Minor Changes

- 9645603: Detect remote compaction support from the active model's `openai-codex-responses` API capability instead of its provider name, while preserving exact model-ID checkpoint replay across persisted summary wording versions.

### Patch Changes

- dc4f90e: Load each extension from a generated source-mapped Jiti runtime while preserving first-use feature boundaries.

## 0.50.1
