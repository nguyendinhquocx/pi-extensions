# 🔐 pi-accounts — Switch Between OAuth Accounts

[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@narumitw/pi-accounts)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@narumitw/pi-accounts) [![Pi extension](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pi-extension-blue)](https://pi.dev) [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)](./LICENSE)

Save and switch named OAuth accounts for Pi's built-in providers.
Each Pi session keeps its own selection for every provider, and choosing `default` restores Pi's normal authentication only for that session without deleting saved accounts.

> [!WARNING]
> Anthropic currently treats Claude Pro/Max use through third-party harnesses as **extra usage billed per token**, rather than consumption of the normal plan allowance.
> Review your Anthropic billing and extra-usage settings before using a named Anthropic account.

## ✨ Features

- Manages named OpenAI Codex, Anthropic Claude Pro/Max, GitHub Copilot, Kimi For Coding, OpenRouter, Radius, and xAI OAuth accounts through `/accounts`.
- Selects an account—or Pi's default login—independently for each provider and Pi session.
- Saves a default account for each provider to use in new sessions without changing existing sessions.
- Restores session selections after resume or reload while allowing concurrent sessions to use different accounts.
- Applies provider-specific credentials, endpoints, headers, and model availability through Pi's built-in providers.
- Refreshes rotating credentials and verifies the effective authentication before reporting success.
- Starts sessions without waiting for routine account selection or provider activation, while gating each provider's first use on verified authentication.
- Offers only the verified active OAuth credential to compatible in-process consumers.
- Writes credentials atomically to a private local file and fails closed for only the affected provider when activation fails.
- Imports legacy `pi-codex-accounts.json` data while retaining the source file for rollback.

## 📦 Install

Install persistently:

```bash
pi install npm:@narumitw/pi-accounts
```

`pi-codex-accounts` is deprecated and archived under `deprecated/`.
Do not load both packages because each can refresh the same rotating Codex credential.
Migrate an existing installation with:

```bash
pi uninstall npm:@narumitw/pi-codex-accounts
pi install npm:@narumitw/pi-accounts
```

Try without installing permanently:

```bash
pi -e npm:@narumitw/pi-accounts
```

Try this package locally from the repository root:

```bash
npm --workspace @narumitw/pi-accounts run build
pi -e ./packages/pi-accounts
```

The package declares `dist/index.ts`, so an unbuilt local checkout must be built before Pi loads the package directory.

## 🚀 Quick start

Run `/accounts` in TUI or RPC mode.
Log in to save a named account, then choose **Set default account → provider → account** to use it when starting a new Pi session.
Use **Switch … account** to change only the current session.

Routine account selection and provider activation continue in the background after Pi starts.
The first prompt, model switch, or `/accounts` operation that needs a provider waits for its current selection and authentication to finish; activation failures still fail that provider closed before a request is sent.

## 🔌 Supported providers

| Provider | Provider ID | Account-specific behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OpenAI Codex | `openai-codex` | ChatGPT Plus/Pro OAuth, OAuth-only native-provider bridge, and Codex WebSocket invalidation |
| Anthropic | `anthropic` | Claude Pro/Max OAuth without interfering with Anthropic API-key auth after returning to `default` |
| GitHub Copilot | `github-copilot` | Individual or Enterprise login, credential-derived API endpoint, and account-specific available models |
| Kimi For Coding | `kimi-coding` | Kimi Code subscription OAuth with provider-owned Bearer-header authentication |
| OpenRouter | `openrouter` | OpenRouter OAuth that mints a persistent account API key without managing manually entered API-key profiles |
| Radius | `radius` | Gateway-bound OAuth with credential-specific dynamic model-catalog refresh and selected-model rebinding |
| xAI | `xai` | SuperGrok or X Premium OAuth with the native xAI provider and model catalog |

## 💬 Commands

Run `/accounts` to log in, switch provider accounts for the current Pi session, set defaults for new sessions, or remove saved accounts in TUI or RPC mode.
Arguments are ignored for compatibility; print and JSON modes provide no account-manager output.
Login uses Pi's native OAuth flow, including device codes and cancellation, with equivalent RPC dialogs.

`default` is reserved for Pi's built-in login.
Switching affects account identity for the chosen provider, not the model or other sessions' selections.
Replacing an existing provider/account name or removing an account requires confirmation.
Removal returns the current session's affected selection to `default`, but other sessions using the removed shared credential fail closed until they choose another account or `default`; see [Security and privacy](#-security-and-privacy).

## ⚙️ Settings

Open `/accounts` → **Set default account**, choose a provider, then select a saved account or **Pi built-in login**.
The picker shows the saved default and saves your selection immediately; leaving it before selecting changes nothing.

Defaults are user-wide settings in `<getAgentDir()>/pi-accounts.json` (normally `~/.pi/agent/pi-accounts.json`); project overrides are not supported.
The existing `providers.<provider-id>.active` field stores the saved account name, so previous values remain compatible without migration.
An absent or `null` value means Pi's built-in login; named values must match a saved account under that provider.
The menu clears `active` when you choose **Pi built-in login** or remove the configured default account.

New sessions, including `/new`, forks, and clones, snapshot these defaults.
A session's saved selection takes precedence on restart, resume, and `/reload`; changing a default never switches that session or other existing sessions.
Login and **Switch … account** still change only the current session, not the startup default.
Sessions predating session-local selection support snapshot the current default once because their historical choice cannot be inferred.
If a manually configured default names a missing account, affected sessions fail closed until you choose an available account or Pi's built-in login.

Saves preserve unknown settings fields and use the credential store's cross-process lock and private atomic replacement.
Within one store, asynchronous reads follow queued writes; failed writes leave the queue usable.
Malformed settings block saves instead of being replaced, and failed saves do not change the session's authentication.

## 🔒 Security and privacy

The extension refreshes each selected account through the provider's OAuth `refresh()` implementation and converts it through `toAuth()`.
It applies the returned API key, headers, and endpoint, then verifies the effective runtime state before reporting success.

If refresh, conversion, provider overlay, or verification fails, the extension installs a non-secret failing runtime credential and aborts turns for that provider.
It does not silently fall back to Pi's built-in login, an environment API key, or another named account.
Other providers remain independent and usable.
Selecting `default` removes the package-owned runtime override and restores the exact provider registration that existed before activation.
Pi's built-in credentials are never deleted.

Session selections are stored as versioned, non-model custom entries in Pi's session JSONL.
The entries contain only provider IDs and account names, not OAuth credentials.
The owning Pi session ID prevents a fork or clone from treating copied parent entries as its own selection.
Resume and reload restore entries owned by the same session, while `/tree` navigation keeps one session-wide selection instead of changing authentication by branch.
A malformed matching selection entry fails managed providers closed until `/accounts` writes a valid snapshot; recovery defaults any other managed provider whose selection could not be trusted.

The extension implements the versioned `oauth:credential-source:v1` protocol for compatible current-account consumers such as usage reporters.
It offers a fresh in-memory clone only after the named OAuth credential has produced and verified active runtime authentication for the exact Pi session.
Pending, default, stale, failed, replaced, reloaded, and shut-down states offer nothing.
Compatible consumers can use the extension-neutral `oauth:credential-readiness:v1` protocol to await the required session-owned activation before requesting an offer.
The protocols do not persist or log the offer, which contains neither the account name nor extension identity.
Consumers must match its access token and provider metadata against freshly resolved runtime authentication.
Without a compatible consumer, account activation works unchanged and no credential is requested.

Pi extensions run with the user's process privileges, and the shared event bus does not isolate installed extensions.
Install only trusted extensions because any extension can read user files and process memory.
The protocol reduces accidental credential coupling; it is not a sandbox.

GitHub Copilot's `availableModelIds` are projected into the active provider model list.
Switching Copilot accounts rebuilds the projection from the complete pre-overlay model catalog.
A currently selected model that is unavailable to the named account is rejected before the turn starts.

Kimi's provider-owned OAuth returns an `Authorization: Bearer` header instead of an API key.
The extension applies that header and installs a non-secret runtime selector to displace Pi's default Kimi credential.
Activation verifies the effective Bearer header and fails closed before a turn if Pi does not retain it.

OpenRouter's provider-owned OAuth returns a persistent API key represented as an OAuth credential with an empty refresh token.
The extension preserves that exact provider credential and does not treat it as a manually managed API-key profile.

Radius OAuth is bound to the active `radius` provider's configured gateway.
The extension refreshes Radius's dynamic model catalog when the session or effective named credential changes, rebinds a retained selected model to its refreshed endpoint, and fails closed if the selected model disappears or catalog publication fails.
Selecting `default` refreshes the Radius catalog against Pi's restored credential after a named account was active.
Shutdown removes named Radius authentication and makes a bounded attempt to restore the default catalog; Pi's next catalog refresh remains the recovery path if the gateway is unavailable during shutdown.
Custom gateways configured for the `radius` provider ID are supported, while arbitrary Radius provider aliases are not.

## 🗄️ Storage and migration

The canonical file is:

```text
~/.pi/agent/pi-accounts.json
```

When `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` is set, the file is stored at `$PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR/pi-accounts.json` instead.
Its versioned structure keeps shared credential maps and startup defaults under separate provider IDs; see [Settings](#-settings) for editing and session precedence.
Credential values are private and must not be committed.
When neither canonical nor legacy storage exists, reads return an empty store without creating a directory or file.
The first account change creates the private canonical file.

On first load, if `pi-accounts.json` does not exist and released `pi-codex-accounts.json` does, the extension:

1. Locks and validates the legacy file.
2. Repairs its permission to `0600`.
3. Copies all Codex credentials and the active name into the `openai-codex` provider section.
4. Atomically installs private `pi-accounts.json`.
5. Retains the private legacy file for rollback.

If both files exist, `pi-accounts.json` takes precedence and the legacy file is not imported again.
The retained legacy refresh token may become stale after `pi-accounts` rotates it, so rollback can require a new Codex login.
Older releases reject files that contain provider sections added later.
Before downgrading, stop Pi, back up the file, and remove the `kimi-coding`, `openrouter`, `radius`, and `xai` sections.

### Rollback

1. Switch managed providers to `default` and stop Pi sessions using `pi-accounts`.
2. Remove `pi-accounts` from the Pi package configuration.
3. Reinstall the deprecated `@narumitw/pi-codex-accounts` package only if necessary.
4. Reauthenticate Codex if the retained legacy refresh token was rotated.

Older `pi-accounts` releases ignore session selection entries and return to the retained provider-level compatibility default.
Select the desired account again after rollback because switches made by this version did not update that global default.

The repository preserves the predecessor implementation under `deprecated/pi-codex-accounts` for reference.
It is excluded from active workspace checks, version bumps, and publishing.

## 🚧 Limitations

- This package manages only provider-owned OAuth accounts.
  It does not store or switch manually entered API-key profiles.
- Continue using Pi's `auth.json`, environment variables, or `!command` secret-manager resolution for API keys.
- It does not rotate accounts automatically, evade quotas, or report usage.
- It does not support arbitrary custom providers.
- Live OAuth login and model requests depend on provider service availability and account entitlement.
- Sessions created before session-local selection support cannot recover a historical per-session choice; see [Settings](#-settings).
