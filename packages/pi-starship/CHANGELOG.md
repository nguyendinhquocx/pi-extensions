# @narumitw/pi-starship

## 0.56.3

### Patch Changes

- 8abd5b7: Keep generated extension runtime graphs inside Pi's Jiti-loaded TypeScript path to avoid duplicate peer-runtime evaluation during startup. Add measured generated runtimes for Context Management, Herdr, and TypeSafe Search.

## 0.56.2

### Patch Changes

- 67a3049: Adapt provider, transcript, usage, deferred-tool, and telemetry behavior to Pi's current runtime contracts, including accurate cache-warming accounting and exclusion from ordinary generation traces.

## 0.56.1

### Patch Changes

- a2803d2: Import the TOML parser instead of resolving it through `createRequire` so settings load under a compiled Pi binary, whose Jiti loader resolves a call-time `require` against the binary's embedded modules rather than the directory the package was installed into. The runtime build now refuses a generated chunk that resolves a package at call time, and the package has the Jiti-loader test its siblings already carry.

## 0.56.0

### Minor Changes

- ff31206: Add ordered exact-match style rules for the provider, model, and thinking modules.

### Patch Changes

- 5e61ff4: Keep timestamped long-term backups when the bundled configuration skill replaces an existing pi-starship document.

## 0.55.1

### Patch Changes

- c5c0151: Avoid periodic TUI redraw requests when cached footer snapshots are unchanged, while preserving clock updates without rescanning session history on idle ticks.

## 0.55.0

### Minor Changes

- f1fffcb: Bundle an authoritative configuration skill with detailed schema, module, runtime, and security references for answering pi-starship setup questions and safely editing or syntax-checking `pi-starship.toml`.

## 0.54.0

### Minor Changes

- b87641b: Show when Pi is waiting for blocking extension UI input and restore the underlying activity after the prompt closes.
  
  Expose `waiting`, `$kind`, and `$title` through pi-starship's activity module.

### Patch Changes

- 36a5ad5: Honor Pi's effective terminal capabilities when rendering pull request hyperlinks and RGB footer colors.

## 0.53.0

### Minor Changes
