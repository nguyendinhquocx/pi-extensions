# 🐑 pi-herdr — Herdr Integration for Pi

[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@narumitw/pi-herdr)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@narumitw/pi-herdr) [![Pi extension](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pi-extension-blue)](https://pi.dev) [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)](./LICENSE)

Connect Pi's interactive lifecycle to Herdr and bootstrap the operating guidance supplied by the installed Herdr CLI.

## ✨ Features

- Reports Pi session identity and `working`, `blocked`, and `idle` lifecycle states to the current Herdr pane.
- Publishes bounded `model`, `provider`, `thinking`, `session`, and `context_usage` tokens for Herdr sidebar rows.
- Shows recognized sibling agents from the current Herdr workspace in a passive widget above Pi's editor, with a saved visibility toggle in `/herdr`.
- Updates the widget from Herdr pane lifecycle and agent-status events without polling the CLI.
- Coalesces rapid state changes and retries short-lived local socket failures without interrupting Pi.
- Derives blocked state from Pi's public `ui_prompt_start` and `ui_prompt_end` lifecycle events.
- Bundles a thin `herdr` bootstrap skill for explicit Herdr inspection and control requests.
- Loads version-matched operating guidance from the installed `herdr --skill` command.
- Keeps extension and skill installation in one Pi package.

## 📦 Install

Install persistently from npm:

```bash
pi install npm:@narumitw/pi-herdr
```

Try from npm without installing permanently:

```bash
pi -e npm:@narumitw/pi-herdr
```

Build and load a local checkout from the repository root:

```bash
npm --workspace @narumitw/pi-herdr run build
pi --no-extensions -e ./packages/pi-herdr
```

An unbuilt local checkout has no generated entrypoint and cannot be loaded by package directory.

Pi extensions and skills run with your user permissions.
Install only trusted packages, and review the source and bundled instructions before loading this package.

## 🚀 Quick start

Start Pi inside a Herdr-managed pane after installing the package.
The extension activates automatically when `HERDR_ENV=1`, `HERDR_SOCKET_PATH`, and `HERDR_PANE_ID` are present.
When the current Herdr workspace contains another recognized agent, Pi shows its state in a widget above the editor.
Ask Pi to use Herdr, or invoke `/skill:herdr`, when you want it to inspect or control the current Herdr session.
Before the first control command, the bootstrap loads `herdr --skill` once and reuses those instructions while they remain in the current context.

If the standalone integration and skill are already installed, remove them after installing this package to avoid duplicate state reports and skill-name collisions:

```bash
rm ~/.pi/agent/extensions/herdr-agent-state.ts
rm -rf ~/.agents/skills/herdr
```

Run `/reload` or restart Pi after changing the installed resources.

## 🧠 Skills

The bundled `herdr` skill loads version-matched operating guidance after an explicit Herdr request.
It treats panes created for background work as temporary and attempts to close them after collecting the required output.
Ask Pi explicitly to keep a pane open after the task when you want to inspect or use it later.
Automatic cleanup runs only when the installed Herdr guidance provides a conditional close that atomically confirms the recorded pane ownership and acceptable agent or shell state; otherwise Pi leaves the pane open and reports the limitation.

## 💬 Commands

`/herdr` opens a menu to toggle the agent widget and view status or help, inspired by `/tool`.
It accepts no arguments and is available inside Herdr in TUI and RPC modes; print and JSON modes reject it.
RPC can save the preference but does not display the widget.
Changes apply immediately and closing the menu does not undo saved changes.

## ⚙️ Settings

Toggle **Agent widget** in `/herdr`, or edit `<getAgentDir()>/pi-herdr.json` (normally `~/.pi/agent/pi-herdr.json`):

```json
{
  "widget": false
}
```

`widget` accepts only `true` or `false` and defaults to `true` when absent.
Only user settings are supported; project files are not read.
Manual edits apply after `/reload` or the next session start.
Missing files are not created until an explicit save. Invalid files trigger a warning, use defaults, and block saves until repaired.
Saves preserve unknown fields and use atomic temporary-file-plus-rename publication, with reads and writes ordered within one Pi process, not across processes.
Failed saves restore the previous effective value and leave the existing file untouched.
Turning the widget off closes its subscription and pending requests without disabling lifecycle or metadata reporting.

## 🔄 Lifecycle reporting

The extension reports only interactive TUI sessions because Herdr displays agents attached to terminal panes.
A session report contains the Herdr pane ID, the integration source, Pi's agent kind, a monotonic sequence, the session start reason, and an absolute Pi session path when available.
It falls back to Pi's session ID when no absolute session path is available.
Agent reports contain the same ownership fields plus the current lifecycle state and optional blocked label.
Blocking extension prompts use their Pi-provided title as the label and fall back to the prompt kind.

Local socket delivery is best-effort.
A failed request is retried once with bounded timeouts, and reporting failures never stop Pi.
Session shutdown aborts in-flight reporting and prevents stale session work from publishing later state.

## 🏷️ Pane metadata

The extension publishes only the `model`, `provider`, `thinking`, `session`, and `context_usage` token keys through `pane.report_metadata` under the `herdr:pi` source.
`model` and `provider` come from Pi's selected model, `thinking` comes from Pi's effective Thinking level, and `session` comes only from Pi's explicit session display name.
`context_usage` is Pi's current context percentage rounded to the nearest whole percent.
Every report is a full five-key patch, and an unavailable value is sent as JSON `null` so old data is cleared instead of retained.
Values are stripped of terminal controls, trimmed, and limited to 80 Unicode characters before crossing the socket.
The extension never publishes prompts, conversation text, tool arguments, credentials, raw session paths, or inferred session titles as metadata tokens.
It also never sets Herdr's pane `title`, `display_agent`, `state_labels`, agent lifecycle state, or session restore fields through metadata.

Metadata is evaluated after `session_start`, `session_info_changed`, `model_select`, `thinking_level_select`, `agent_settled`, and successful `session_compact` events.
Unchanged event snapshots are suppressed, rapid changes are coalesced, and the latest unchanged snapshot is refreshed no more often than every 30 minutes.
Each token has a one-hour TTL, so data from a crashed Pi process expires without steady socket traffic.
Orderly shutdown sends one best-effort five-key clear patch, while abrupt shutdown and failed clears fall back to the TTL.
Metadata uses the lifecycle reporter's monotonic sequence allocator and bounded best-effort sender, so older delayed reports cannot replace newer accepted values and socket failures never interrupt Pi.

Herdr custom pane tokens use a `$name` row entry.
For example, this Herdr configuration displays Pi's model context without replacing pane labels or agent identity:

```toml
[ui.sidebar.agents]
rows = [
  ["state_icon", "agent"],
  ["$provider", "$model", "$thinking"],
  ["$session", "$context_usage"],
]
```

## 🐑 Agent widget

The widget lists only recognized agents in the current Herdr workspace and excludes the pane running the current Pi session.
Each row presents state, agent, pane, and workspace in that order, using theme hierarchy instead of repeating field labels.
State icons follow Herdr's distinct static symbols: `×` blocked, `◐` working, `✓` done, `○` idle, and `·` unknown.
Pi theme roles map blocked to `error`, working to `warning`, done to `accent`, idle to `success`, and unknown to `dim` without hard-coded terminal colors.
Agent identity prefers the name assigned by `herdr agent rename`, then Herdr display metadata, and finally the detected agent kind.
Pane identity uses its label or metadata title with a short pane ID, while workspace identity uses its label with a short workspace ID.
Terminal titles are not used as agent identity.
The widget orders agents by `blocked`, `done`, `working`, `idle`, and `unknown`, shows at most five rows, and reports any remaining count.
A state label published through Herdr metadata can replace the raw state name.
Herdr's public pane responses do not expose the blocked prompt message, so the widget cannot show that reason.
The widget is read-only and does not focus panes, read terminal output, send prompts, or mark a background `done` state as seen.
The extension discovers the current workspace, pane list, and agent names, opens pane-scoped status subscriptions plus topology subscriptions, and then reloads those identities to reconcile changes made during initialization.
Expected pane creation, movement, or agent detection rebuilds the pane-scoped subscriptions without consuming the bounded failure retry.
Unexpected disconnection clears the widget before one bounded reconnect attempt, and a second failure leaves it hidden until the next Pi session or `/reload`.
Session replacement and shutdown abort the subscription, pending requests, reconnect delay, and stale widget publication.

## 🔒 Security and privacy

The extension connects only to the Unix socket or Windows named pipe provided by `HERDR_SOCKET_PATH`.
Lifecycle reporting sends the current Herdr pane ID, Pi session path or ID, lifecycle state, session start reason, and blocked label to that endpoint.
Metadata reporting sends the current Herdr pane ID plus only the selected model ID, provider ID, effective Thinking level, explicit Pi session name, and rounded context-usage percentage.
For the widget, it reads the canonical current pane, current workspace metadata, current workspace pane list, and session agent list, then subscribes to pane creation, closure, movement, exit, agent detection, and agent-status events.
The session agent list can contain agent metadata from other workspaces, but the extension retains names only for panes in the current workspace list.
Widget fields can include workspace, tab, pane, terminal, agent, display, name, title, label, state-label, and lifecycle identifiers supplied by Herdr.
The subscription can deliver matching pane events from other workspaces in the same Herdr session, and the extension ignores them after resolving the current workspace.
The extension filters presentation to the current workspace, strips terminal controls at the display boundary, and never reads sibling terminal output for the widget.
The package does not authenticate the endpoint, so trust the environment that launches Pi and controls these variables.

The bundled bootstrap loads operating guidance from the local `herdr --skill` command only after an explicit user request involving Herdr.
The returned CLI-owned skill can direct Pi to inspect terminals, create panes, start agents, send input, and run commands through the local `herdr` CLI.
Those commands execute with the same user permissions as Pi and can affect live terminal sessions.
The bootstrap stops when `HERDR_ENV` is not `1`, when the CLI is unavailable, or when `herdr --skill` fails.
Command recipes, approval handling, and other operating safety rules come from the installed Herdr version instead of being duplicated by this package.

## 🚧 Limitations

- Lifecycle reporting, metadata reporting, and the agent widget are disabled in RPC, JSON, and print modes.
- The widget has no settings for placement, workspace scope, or row count.
- The widget cannot show blocked prompt text because Herdr does not expose it through public pane responses.
- Herdr exposes no rename event, so agent and pane renames appear after the next topology refresh, reconnect, Pi `/reload`, or session start rather than immediately.
- Integration requires a running compatible Herdr session and valid injected environment variables.
- Model control requires an installed Herdr CLI that supports `herdr --skill`.
- Socket failures are intentionally silent after the bounded retry.
- Skill cleanup tracking exists only in the active model context, so compaction, session replacement, `/reload`, or shutdown can leave temporary panes open.
- The package does not install, start, update, or configure Herdr itself.
