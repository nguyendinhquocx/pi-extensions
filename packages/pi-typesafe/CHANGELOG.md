# @narumitw/pi-typesafe

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- afec31b: Use the official TypeSafe JavaScript SDK for direct TypeSafe requests while retaining the opt-in OpenRouter transport, strict response validation, bounded I/O, cancellation, and disabled automatic retries.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 7baa014: Add a Pi extension with a `typesafe_question` tool that exposes typed Jev decisions through TypeSafe's official API, offers an experimental OpenRouter fallback enabled through package-owned settings, and bundles a TypeSafe skill with local design, integration, migration, and cookbook references.

### Patch Changes

- ab0d1bf: Restrict malformed-settings lifecycle diagnostics to print and JSON modes so unsupported headless contexts continue with defaults.
